# Tell me about yourself.
My name is Eugene and I am a software developer with more than eight years of experience, specializing in frontend development. I graduated from Moscow Aviation Institute as a Master of Computer Engineering in 2014 (5.5 year curriculum focusing on application development, networks, algorithms, software architecture design, microprocessors and peripherals). 
I started my career as an engineer at JSC "NIIP named after V.V. Tikhomirov", working with C/C++ languages, and later moved to backend development using C# at CROC company. 
Over time, I gained experience in full stack development, but ultimately found my passion in frontend development. I have had the opportunity to work with various companies, including banks and courts, where I developed high-quality user interfaces. 
In my previous role at ITFB Group, I led a team of developers to build a marketplace for the sale of building materials from scratch, utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as ReactJS, Redux, and Typescript. 
My skills also extend to software architecture development, UI design, and software testing, and I have strong leadership abilities including team management, mentoring, and task decomposition. I am thrilled at the opportunity to join your company as a frontend developer and contribute my skills and experience to the team.

# What is your greatest strength?
My greatest strength is my ability to quickly learn and master new technologies. As a front-end developer, I'm always seeking out new tools and frameworks that can help me create more efficient and effective user interfaces. During my time at CROC, I faced a challenge where there was a shortage of backend projects, and I had to quickly learn JavaScript and become certified in a short amount of time to work on a frontend project. This experience has taught me the importance of being adaptable and versatile in the fast-paced world of software development. I am confident that my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies will bring value to your company.

# What is your greatest weakness?
During my initial experience as a team lead, I encountered difficulties with task delegation as I was accustomed to managing all responsibilities by myself. To tackle this issue, I focused on enhancing my time management and prioritization skills. I maintained consistent communication with my team, started utilizing project management tools such as time-tracking software and to-do lists to stay organized and see the progress of my team.
# Why should we hire you?

I believe that I can bring value to your organization through my technical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and strong work ethic. I am proficient in various frontend technologies. I am also highly motivated and committed to continuous learning and improvement, which enables me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. Moreover, I am a team player who values collaboration, open communication, and constructive feedback. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your organization and help you achieve your business objectives.

# Tell me about a time you showed leadership.
To ensure the project's success, I held regular meetings with the team to discuss the project's scope, and I encouraged them to share their ideas and concerns. I also helped to decompose tasks into sprints and provided guidance to the team on software architecture development and software UI development.
One particular instance where I demonstrated leadership was when we faced a technical issue that caused significant delays in the project's progress. I took charge of the situation by collaborating with the team to identify the problem's root cause and implement an effective solution.
As a result, we were able to deliver the project on time and within budget, which was greatly appreciated by both our stakeholders and customers. This experience helped me realize the importance of effective communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills when leading a team, and I believe it will be an asset in any future leadership roles.

# Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.
Sure, I'd be happy to share an example of when I was successful on a team. In my previous role as a Team Lead Frontend Developer at ITFB Group, I led a team of five developers with Scrum methodology in the development of a new development marketplace for the sale of building materials from scratch. As the team leader, I helped to prepare and decompose tasks into sprints, ensured that the team stayed on track and worked effectively together. I also mentored two junior developers, helping them to improve their skills and learn new technologies.
Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the backend development team to ensure seamless integration between the frontend and backend systems. Through effective communication, coordination, and leadership, we were able to complete the project on time and within budget, delivering a high-quality product that met the client's requirements.
Overall, I believe that my strong leadership skills, coupled with my technical expertise, allowed me to be successful on this project and to make a valuable contribution to the team.

# What would your co-workers say about you?
I hope that they would likely describe me as a reliable and hardworking person who is always willing to lend a helping hand to others. They would appreciate my positive attitude and ability to work well under pressure. They may also highlight my ability to communicate effectively, share knowledge and experience with them, and adapt to changes and challenges in the workplace.
Why do you want to leave your current role?
Due to the relocation to Turkey, and necessity to work remotely abroad (political company rules). But I have great relationships.

# Describe your most challenging project.
During my time at CROC, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project for an exhibition in Dubai. We were given only a few basic descriptions from the Dubai Police client and had to come up with a prototype that would be both creative and functional. One idea for a real-world app that I find particularly exciting is a tool that could assist law enforcement in identifying and tracking criminals. This app would enable officers to quickly and easily input information about a suspect, including physical characteristics and last known location, and receive real-time updates on their whereabouts. Overall, I believe that such an app has the potential to greatly enhance public safety and help law enforcement agencies to better serve their communities.
To tackle these challenges, we made sure to have regular communication with the Dubai team to ensure that we were aligned and any issues were addressed promptly. Additionally, we conducted extensive research on the cultural and language nuances specific to Dubai to ensure that our design and content were appropriate for the audience.
Despite the challenges, we were able to successfully deliver the project on time and within budget. The client was extremely satisfied with the end result, and we were proud to have contributed to the success of the exhibition.

# Tell me about something you’ve accomplished that you are proud of.
I have completed numerous successful projects and tasks throughout my career, but one that stands out to me is a project I worked on during my first job. In that project, I developed a test program for the train's blocks of controlling speed, breaks and door closing and that helped to solve a real-world problem. It allowed us to test the blocks before they were set on the train, which in turn helped to increase safety for passengers.

And one of latest is app for Dubai Police.

# Can you explain your employment gap?
Due to relocation and vacation.
  
# What are your salary expectations?
After researching market ranges from multiple sources online and taking into account my education, experience, and location, I’m targeting roles with base salaries in the range of [60-70 dollars]. Of course, I’m also taking into account opportunities for long-term growth with an emphasis on purpose-driven work as I evaluate and weigh options — and my values are closely aligned with your organization’s mission. I intend to be a high performing asset to your company.

I am seeking a base salary within the range of $[dollar amount] to $[dollar amount]. I’ve seen similar roles that are offering $[dollar amount]. My specific experience and years in the field are closely aligned with this position, making me a strong candidate to be able to jump in and quickly add value. 

That said, I understand that this base salary range might be on the higher end of the spectrum for a growing company, and I’m willing to consider a lesser base paired with a signing bonus or increase in restricted stock units. My intention is to grow with the company and invest myself in its success. 

# What do you like to do outside of work?
I am passionate about traveling to other countries, going to the gym and skiing.
Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.
During my time as a frontend developer at ITFB company, I was assigned to work on multiple projects simultaneously, each with their own deadlines and priorities. At one point, I was tasked with completing a redesign for a high-priority client while also implementing new features for a separate project that had a fast-approaching launch date.
To manage these conflicting priorities, I first communicated with my manager to gain clarity on the deadlines and importance of each project. I then created a detailed plan outlining the tasks and timelines for each project, prioritizing the high-priority client project and allocating time for the new feature implementation in between.
I also collaborated with the project managers and other team members involved to ensure that everyone was aware of the plan and any potential delays or issues that may arise. By staying organized, communicating effectively, and managing my time efficiently, I was able to successfully complete both projects on time and to the satisfaction of the clients.

# Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
I have just started to seek  work for a European company. So in 5 years it would be great to have a great experience on that way.

# Describe your leadership style.
In a word, supportive. I think it is important to understand the unique strengths and blind spots of my team members and direct reports. Knowing how to work with a range of experience, skills, and working styles plays a big role in the success of a team. To effectively lead, I had to know when to step in and course correct, and when to let them make their own mistakes and learn by experience for maximum growth.

# Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake.
Three years ago, I was tasked with estimating the time it would take to develop an application. The problem was that there was no MVP design, only rough notes of what needed to be done. I estimated that it would take one week, but there were a series of misunderstandings and the final time ended up being double my estimate. While this mistake did not reflect poorly on me as an employee, it taught me to ask more questions, request detailed designs and descriptions, and understand the depth of the task before providing estimates. 

# Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person.
In my experience, I believe that people are not inherently difficult. Rather, differences in backgrounds and levels of information can make it challenging to understand another person's perspective. I encountered a situation where I had a clear idea of how to develop a feature based on my previous experience, and I knew what the back-end developer needed to do. However, the back-end developer wanted to simplify the solution, which made it difficult to come to an agreement. To resolve this, I took the time to explain the details to the developer and provided them with resources to help them understand better. We were able to have a positive argument, and in the end, the feature was completed successfully.

# Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone.
	The same as before.
  
# Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone.
This is a part of my work to disagree and offer better solutions. The same as before.

# Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it.
I needed to learn a book for the JS exam..

# Tell me about a time you surpassed people’s expectations.
The same as 24.

# Tell me about a time you had to handle pressure.
During my time at ITFB, I was tasked with investigating a neighboring team's project that had been stagnant for six months. I discovered a chain of misunderstandings that were rooted in the project leads' lack of experience. Originally intended as a simple prototype, the project's requirements were continuously being rewritten, eventually turning it into a must-have. To solve this, I collaborated with UX/UI designers to create an MVP and presented my findings to the managers, persuading them that we should focus on developing the MVP within 2-3 months before completing the first stage. Our efforts paid off, and we successfully developed the MVP, allowing us to continue on doing the remaining work.

# Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.
As a developer, the ability to learn quickly is essential. I have a personal example that demonstrates this well. While working for CROC, I primarily worked as a backend developer, but my resource manager informed me that there were no projects available that matched my skill set. They suggested that I learn Javascript and switch to working on frontend projects instead.
I took the initiative to read books on the subject and even passed a Windows certification exam before starting my first project using Angular, a technology I had never previously used. Through this experience, I was able to transition into a frontend developer role and expand my skill set.

# Do you have any questions for me?
Tell me about the interview process.
Could you tell me about taxes in your company country?
